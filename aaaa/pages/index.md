Hi, I guess.

Just so you know who you are dealing with... I am a high school student. I enjoy programming in Javascript and Python as well as building robots and other mechanical things.

I haven't done much yet, on Github or otherwise, but I have plenty of ideas. Some of them work out, others don't, and this site is partially the result.

Below are some of the more notable ideas I have done, along with links to their description pages. I will note here that this list may, at times, be out of date. The best place to check is [my Github repositories list](https://github.com/dragoncoder047?tab=repositories) which includes everything and is sorted by when I last did something with it.

**NEW** March 20, 2022: I have [a blog](/blog)! May as well check that too.

## Phoo

A little scripting language I invented based on the principle that everything is a stack. Javascript source code [on Github](https://github.com/phoo-lang/phoo). Based off of another scripting language called Quackery, [code for that here](https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery). Phoo's [documentation](https://phoo-lang.github.io/docs/) is primitive, cobbled together by a little Python script, and I haven't written a good tutorial, but Phoo works well and the code is impressively concise compared to vanilla Javascript.

## Armdroid

In early 2022 I discovered two old Armdroid 1000's and their accessories in the back of my engineering teacher's storage closet. So I put together a site with pictures of the robots and links to other resources I found on the Web. [Have a look at it here.](/armdroid/) I'm on summer break right now and don't have access to the Armdroids, so don't expect any updates soon.

## Thuepaste

For a while in March 2022 I was really interested in the [Thue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language)) programming language and wrote a little interpreter for it (which you can [find here](/thuepaste/)). I tried to write a function that would determine if any given Thue-machine would halt without actually running it (result: fail, fail, fail). Aside from making more demo programs, I don't think I'll get back to this anytime soon.
