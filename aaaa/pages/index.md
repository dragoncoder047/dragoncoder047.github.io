Just so you know who you are dealing with... I am a high schooler. I enjoy programming in Javascript and Python as well as building robots and other mechanical things.

I haven't done much yet, on Github or otherwise, but I have plenty of ideas. Some of them work out, others don't, and this site is partially the result.

Below are some of the more notable ideas I have done, along with links to their description pages. I will note here that this list may, at times, be out of date. The best place to check is [my Github repositories list](https://github.com/dragoncoder047?tab=repositories) which includes everything and is sorted by when I last did something with it.

## Thuepaste

For a while in March 2022 I was really interested in the [Thue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language)) programming language and wrote a little interpreter for it (which you can find [here](/thuepaste/)). I tried to write a function that would determine if any given Thue-machine would halt without actually running it (result: fail, fail, fail). Aside from making more demo programs, I don't think I'll get back to this anytime soon.

## Phoo

A little scripting language I invented. Javascript source code on Github [here](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/phoo). Based off of another scripting language called Quackery, code for that [here](https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery). Currently a work in progress, completely untested, and probably broken. No demo page yet.
