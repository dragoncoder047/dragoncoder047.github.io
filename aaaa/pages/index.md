Hi, I guess.

Just so you know who you are dealing with... I am a high school student. I enjoy programming in Javascript and Python as well as building robots and other mechanical things.

I haven't done much yet, on Github or otherwise, but I have plenty of ideas. Some of them work out, others don't, and this site is partially the result.

Below are some of the more notable ideas I have done, along with links to their description pages. I will note here that this list may, at times, be out of date. The best place to check is [my Github repositories list](https://github.com/dragoncoder047?tab=repositories) which includes everything and is sorted by when I last did something with it.

## Yisp

Yisp is going to be a Lisp-ish scripting language interpreter for microcontrollers, adapted from David Johnson-Davies' uLisp. This serves as my self-introduction to C++ and I am going to use it in susequent microcontroller projects (most of which still "in the womb" in terms of how far they have been developed -- not worthy of being listed here yet). The code is [here](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/yisp), but it's incomplete, and I've never even tried to compile it yet so it may even be syntactically incorrect. Use at your own risk.

## Phoo

A little scripting language I invented based on the principle that everything is a stack. I haven't used it "in" anything yet, and the shell is kind of broken, but Phoo has loads of possibilities of what can be done because it is just a general purpose programming language. Javascript source code [on Github](https://github.com/phoo-lang/phoo). Phoo started as a Javascript port of another scripting language called [Quackery](https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery), but took a left turn early on in development and is nothing like Quackery anymore. Phoo's [documentation](https://phoo-lang.github.io/docs/index.html) is primitive, cobbled together by a little Python script, but Phoo works well and the code is impressively concise compared to vanilla Javascript.

## Armdroid

In early 2022 I discovered two old Armdroid 1000's and their accessories in the back of my engineering teacher's storage closet. So I put together a site with pictures of the robots and links to other resources I found on the Web. [Have a look at it here.](/armdroid/)

## Schemascii

In late September 2022 I was fooling around with the parts of the Armdroid and wanted to make circuit diagrams. I am not trained in and major EDA software like KiCad, and none run in a Web browser at any rate, so I decided to do ASCII art drawings. The closest thing to what I wanted -- Jovansonlee Cesar's [svgbob](https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbob) -- doesn't wuite work the way I want it to, so I decided to write my own program. Schemascii is designed specifically for circuit diagrams, and is written in Python so it can be embedded into a Python-Markdown-rendered site (which is what this site is, and what I plan to do once Schemascii is complete.)

## Langton-Music

In late June 2022 I had the idea to try and create music from Langton's Ant and other types of two-dimensional Turing machines. The little simulator I built isn't polished in terms of UI, but it works. I haven't had much of a chance to play around with it. In September I redesigned it completely and the new version is [here](/langton-music/index.html). (You can find the old June version [here](/ca-experiments/langton-music/index.html).)

## Thuepaste

For a while in March 2022 I was really interested in the [Thue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language)) programming language and wrote a little interpreter for it (which you can [find here](/thuepaste/)). I tried to write a function that would determine if any given Thue-machine would halt without actually running it, and no matter what I tried, it either crashed or hung. My idea seems like it would work, I just can't figure out how to implement it. Aside from making more demo programs, I don't think I'll get back to this much at all.
