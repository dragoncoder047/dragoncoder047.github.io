Title: LifeViewer test
Status: draft

```lifeviewer
x = 13, y = 5, rule = Bliptile
3CA9C$C2.B8.C$C2.10C$C2.2C$4C!
```

Lifeviewer requests `.rule` files at `/wiki/Rule:%s` (where `%s` is the rule) so it will work on <https://conwaylife.com> okay. But https://dragoncoder047.github.io/wiki/ will probably never exist, so something needs to be fixed for LifeViewer to work here.
