Static files and top-level content for my site.

The `aaaa/` directory is the source Markdown files for my site. I chose that name because the output directory that Pelican builds into is actually the root directory and I am pretty sure that I am not going to create anything called `aaaa` and have a name collision.

`build.py` is my pelicanconf file, but made executable with a shebang and this at the end:

```py3
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import os
    os.system(f'pelican {PATH} -o {OUTPUT_PATH} -s {__file__}')
```

No more clunky Makefile!

`drafts/` and `images/` are automatically generated by Pelican. `images/` (should) be the same as `aaaa/images/`, while `drafts/` is all of the files in `aaaa/` marked as `Status: draft` at the top.
