Just so you know who you are dealing with...

I am a college student. I enjoy programming in Python, C/C++, and Javascript, as well as reverse-engineering, hacking, and building robots, especially the electronics side of stuff.

## Projects I work on

[Click here for a list of all the major projects I have going right now.]({filename}projects.md)

## Stuff I've written

[I have a blog](/blog) where I explain my thoughts about what I'm working on, show off my prior work, explore new topics, and hate on Chromebooks.

## The other incarnations of me

Cellular automata is one of my interests, and while I don't spend much time on it I do contribute to the [conwaylife.com forums under the username **wirehead**](https://conwaylife.com/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2991).

#### Look Mom, I have a YouTube channel! (jumps up and down)

[My YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@dragoncoder047). Mostly electronics, LEGO machines, and goofing around with friends.
