Just so you know who you are dealing with...

I am a college student. I enjoy programming in Python, C, C++, and Javascript/Typescript, as well as reverse-engineering, hacking, and building robots, especially the electronics side of stuff.

## Projects I work on

[Click here for a list of all the major projects I have going right now.]({filename}projects.md)

## Stuff I've written

[I have a blog](/blog) where I explain my thoughts about what I'm working on, show off my prior work, explore new topics, and hate on Chromebooks.

## The other incarnations of me

Cellular automata is one of my interests, and while I don't spend much time on it I do contribute to the [conwaylife.com forums](https://conwaylife.com/forums/) under the username [**wirehead**](https://conwaylife.com/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2991).

[My YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@dragoncoder047). Mostly electronics, LEGO machines, and goofing around with friends. These are longer videos of what I'm more proud of. Occasionally a "hey, this is cool" type video gets uploaded but not too often.

[My Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/dragoncoder047/). There isn't much there yet but I intend to use this for sharing screenshots and photos of in-progress projects that aren't at the point where I would make a blog post or Youtube video about it. I am also on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@dragoncoder047).
