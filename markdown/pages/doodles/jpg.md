Title: Raster Doodles
Modified: 12-06-2025

There were two raster image projects in the graphic design class I took. I am ashamed to admit these were made in Adobe Photoshop. Unfortunately neither I nor my teacher were allowed to install [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) on the lab computers due to my college IT department's lengthy software security review process.

The first project was called "Preposterous Persona" (by the department, I didn't choose that name), and required the use of some of the simple image manipulation tools such as selection, move and transform, eraser, cage/puppet warp, and filter/adjustment layers. I went to town with the puppet warp tool on this one.

The second project was called "Beyond Confines" and it involved using the non-destructive edting tools, mostly layer masks. This one was actually a bit harder for me to create, mostly because I could not find any stock images of a person sitting in the pose I was looking for. So I did the next best thing and took a photo of myself.

    %: Interesting note: I do not own a Playstation Portal nor any other handheld gaming console (Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, etc). In the original photo I used, I was holding a book. But thanks to the magic of image editing you'll never notice that!
