Title: Raster Doodles
Modified: 12-06-2025

There were technically two vector image projects in the graphic design class I took, although they built on each other and only one image was produced as a result, so I will be treating them as two halves of the same project. I am ashamed to admit these were made in Adobe Illustrator. Unfortunately neither I nor my teacher were allowed to install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) on the lab computers due to my college IT department's lengthy software security review process.

The two of them combined were called the "Blend of Divergent Design" project. I am not really sure what that means. The first half of the project was to make the background scene from a reference image that I took, and the second half was to make the forground using a separate reference image and then superimpose it on top of the background scene.

I used an image of my basement workshop combined with a photo of myself standing over a table to make the base. I also had to grab a few more reference images for some of the junk sitting on the floor, since there's no way I could freehand something that complicated like I did with the breadboard and oscilloscope.
