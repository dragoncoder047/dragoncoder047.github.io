Title: Doodles!

Hi again! I'm **dragoncoder047**, currently a college student. I'm not an artist, but I have made some things that could conceptually be called art. And in the fall of 2025 I took an introductory graphic design course as my art elective.

Currently, the stuff here is only the projects and art that I made for that class. I may add more later.
