Title: LifeViewer test
Status: draft

```lifeviewer
x = 13, y = 5, rule = Bliptile
3AC9A$A2.B8.A$A2.10A$A2.2A$4A!
[[ WIDTH 1000 HEIGHT 800 ]]
```

Lifeviewer requests `.rule` files at `/wiki/Rule:%s` (where `%s` is the rule) so it will work on <https://conwaylife.com> okay. ~~But https://dragoncoder047.github.io/wiki/ will probably never exist, so something needs to be fixed for LifeViewer to work here.~~ *It does now.*
