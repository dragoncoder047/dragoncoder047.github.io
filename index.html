    <p>Hi, I guess.</p>
<p>Just so you know who you are dealing with&hellip; I am a high school student. I enjoy programming in Python, C++, and Javascript, as well as reverse-engineering, hacking, and building robots.</p>
<p>Below are some of the more notable ideas I have done, along with links to their description pages. I will note here that this list may, at times, be out of date. The best place to check is <a href="https://github.com/dragoncoder047?tab=repositories">my Github repositories list</a> which includes everything and is sorted by when I last did something with it.</p>
<h2 id="ulisp-fork">uLisp fork</h2>
<p>I wanted to be able to embed a scripting language on an Arduino so I don&rsquo;t have to use a C compiler on another computer to reprogram it. uLisp didn&rsquo;t quite work because at the time it ws difficult to add extensions, so I fooled around for a while and then settled on LIL (see below). In late March 2023 a new version of uLisp was released that allows people to add their own extension files a lot easier, and so I decided I would use uLisp as a scripting language for my microcontroller (because it works and is well-supported) instead of LIL. In the process of working with it, I found a lot of bugs and was able to fix them, and also offer improvements, some of which have been merged upstream. I also wrote some of my own extensions. And, after I got sick of the stupid Arduino serial monitor, I wrote my own Python bridge program that gives you a little nicer interaction experience when connected to a microcontroller running uLisp. The code is here: <a href="https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ulisp-esp32">https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ulisp-esp32</a></p>

<h2 id="lilduino">LILduino</h2>
<p>After several false starts with older versions of uLisp and writing my own languages, I found that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/">LIL</a> runs on a microcontroller. I wrote a few C++ extension modules that hook into Arduino functions and libraries (GPIO, SD, cards, infrared communication, regular expressions, etc.), and basically have turned LIL into a crude operating system for any microprocessor that has enough horsepower to run it. Code here: <a href="https://github.com/dragoncoder047/lilduino">https://github.com/dragoncoder047/lilduino</a></p>

<h2 id="schemascii">Schemascii</h2>
<p>In late September 2022 I was fooling around with the PCB&rsquo;s of the Armdroid (see below) and wanted to make circuit diagrams. I am not trained in and major EDA software like KiCad, and none I know of run in a web browser at any rate, so I decided to do ASCII art drawings. The closest thing to what I wanted &ndash; Jovansonlee Cesar&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbob">svgbob</a> &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t quite work the way I want it to, so I wrote my own program. Schemascii is designed specifically for circuit diagrams, and is written in Python so it can be embedded into a Python-Markdown-rendered site (such as my blog). There is also a CLI program for rendering standalone images. Schemascii is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/dragoncoder047/schemascii">https://github.com/dragoncoder047/schemascii</a></p>

<h2 id="armdroid">Armdroid</h2>
<p>In early 2022 I discovered two old Armdroid 1000&rsquo;s and their accessories in the back of my engineering teacher&rsquo;s storage closet, remnants from the days that my school taught <a href="https://www.pltw.org/computer-integrated-manufacturing-course-outline">PLTW Computer Integrated Manufaturing</a>. I put together a website with pictures of the robots and links to other resources I found on the Web. <a href="/armdroid/">Have a look at it here.</a> This site also documents my efforts to reverse-engineer the Armdroid and control it with an Arduino Uno, which have been mildly successful.</p>

<h2 id="langton-music">Langton-Music</h2>
<p>In late June 2022 I had the idea to try and create music from Langton&rsquo;s Ant and other types of two-dimensional Turing machines. The little simulator I built isn&rsquo;t terribly polished in terms of UI, but it works, and I actually managed to set it up so it is installable as a progressive web app. I haven&rsquo;t had much of a chance to play around with it. <a href="/langton-music/index.html">You can find it here</a>. Bug reports and feature requests can go on <a href="https://github.com/dragoncoder047/langton-music/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>, and everything else can go on <a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;p=147432">this conwaylife.com forum thread</a>.</p>

<h2 id="phoo">Phoo</h2>
<p>A little scripting language I invented based on the principle that everything is a stack. Phoo started as a Javascript port of another scripting language called <a href="https://github.com/GordonCharlton/Quackery">Quackery</a>, but took a left turn early on in development and is nothing like Quackery anymore. Phoo is a whole lot faster than Quackery and works well and the code is impressively concise compared to the equivalent Javascript or Python. I haven&rsquo;t used Phoo &ldquo;in&rdquo; anything yet, and the shell is kind of broken, but Phoo has loads of possibilities of what can be done because it is just a general purpose programming language. Javascript source code <a href="https://github.com/phoo-lang/phoo">on Github</a>. Phoo&rsquo;s <a href="https://phoo-lang.github.io/docs/index.html">documentation</a> is a bit primitive, cobbled together by a little Python script, but everything that needs to be documented is documented relatively thouroughly on that link for the outward-facing Phoo words, and as JSDoc comments for Phoo&rsquo;s internals.</p>

<h2 id="thuepaste">Thuepaste</h2>
<p>For a brief spat in March 2022 I got myself obsessed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language)">Thue programming language</a> and wrote <a href="/thuepaste/">a little interpreter for it</a> and a few demo programs, which are included along with a bunch of other demos I found on the internet. I came up with an idea for an algorithm that would determine the probablilty of any given Thue-machine halting, but without actually running it. Unfortunately, no matter what approach I took to trying to implement it, it either crashed, got stuck in a loop for hours, ran out of memory, or did some other horrible thing to my browser to make it so slow I had to force-quit and restart it on multiple occasions. My idea seems like it would work, I just can&rsquo;t figure out how to implement it. Aside from making more demo programs, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get back to this much at all.</p>
